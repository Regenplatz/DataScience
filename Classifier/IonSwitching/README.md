### About the project
Data on 10 different ion channels was analyzed for classification purpose. The dataset contained information about time, signal and open channels.

Data was obtained from  [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/liverpool-ion-switching) and loaded to [IonSwitching.ipynb](IonSwitching.ipynb) for preprocessing and visualization.
The preprocessed dataframe was saved and further used for supervised *Machine Learning* in [Liverpool_IonSwitching.py](Liverpool_IonSwitching.py). It was designed as an automated approach to find the best suitable model for prediction. It was built to show advantages of engineering for automation and focused less on highlighting a single Machine Learning algorithm.

NOTE: If you want to get a first and less time-consuming impression on my [Liverpool_IonSwitching.py](Liverpool_IonSwitching.py) approach, run the script with lines 160-176 and 182-189 being commented.
