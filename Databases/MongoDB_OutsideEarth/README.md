## Outside Earth

This project demonstrates an `ELT` process in which different unstructured data is being fetched via public APIs, loaded to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com), transformed and queried.

All this is demonstrated and documented in [outsideEarth.ipynb](outsideEarth.ipynb).

The data being used includes infos on
- our solar system ([API]("https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/rest/bodies/"))
- some supernovae ([API]("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astrocatalogs/sne-2015-2019/master/"))
- location of the *International Space Station* (ISS) ([API]("https://api.wheretheiss.at/v1/satellites/25544"))
