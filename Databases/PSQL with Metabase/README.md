### About the project
This project was set up to build a `Northwind database` from the associated tables.

Tables were taken from [here](
https://github.com/pawlodkowski/northwind_data_clean/tree/master/data).

The Northwind database was initially created and queried using `Bash`.
Exemplary queries are available here: [Northwind_Querys](Northwind_Querys)

Some queries were exemplarily visualized on a `Dashboard` using [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/). Metabase API was saved locally and got to run via Bash command `$ java -jar metabase.jar`. Metabase was then opened on `localhost` to view in the browser and build the dashboard. Further queries were also performed via Metabase.

To finally create a pdf, plots were exported from Metabase and summarized using PowerPoint.
