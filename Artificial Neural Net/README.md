### About the Projects
Deep learning was performed for different kinds of artificial neural nets using a keras/tensorflow environment.

#  
#### Artificial Neural Net
An artifical neural network was built that was able to recognize handwritten digits from the `MNIST dataset`. Data was imported via `from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist` (see [ArtificialNN](ArtificialNN.ipynb)).


#  
#### Convolutional Neural Net
Like in ArtificialNN, the MNIST data set was used. Deep learning was performed using CNN instead (see [ConvolutionalNN](ConvolutionalNN.ipynb)).

#  
#### Recurrent Neural Net
A recurrent neural net was built that was able to differentiate between `contrary views in texts`. Data was imported via `from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups`
(see [RecurrentNN](RecurrentNN.ipynb)).
