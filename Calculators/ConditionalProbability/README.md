### Calculator for Conditional Probabilities
**Jupyter Widgets** were used to create a graphical user interface (GUI) which makes it possible to enter values in some of the twelve fields within the jupyter notebook [Calculator.ipynb](Calculator.ipynb).

Values for the empty remaining fields are then calculated based on the given values by clicking the <img src="ButtonCalculate.PNG" alt="drawing" width="20%"/> button.

The fields can be cleared by clicking the <img src="ButtonClear.PNG" alt="drawing" width="20%"/> button e.g. after calculation or to be ready to start a new one.

Interactive fields and buttons are located at the end of the file [Calculator.ipynb](Calculator.ipynb).

Code was outsourced to the python file [ConditionalProbability.py](ConditionalProbability.py).

NOTE: Fields and buttons are not visible on GitHub preview of [Calculator.ipynb](Calculator.ipynb). You should see them if you run the file locally on your computer.
