## Calculate Sample Size of a Population

[CalculationSamplesSize.ipynb](CalculationSampleSize.ipynb) contains formulas to evaluate the required sample size of a population at a given `confidence interval` and a desired `margin of error`. For the calculations, the required `z-score` is looked up in a [table](zScore.xlsx), beforehand.

The calculations are the following:
1. Standard Formula
2. Formula for Unknown or Hugh Populations
3. Slovin's Formula (when no further knowledge about the population is available)
